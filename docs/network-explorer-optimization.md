# Network Explorer Optimization Summary

## Implemented Improvements

1. **Route-first explorer quick search.** The quick-search form now pushes the resolved path immediately, prefetches the destination, and performs wallet-based type refinement in the background so navigation is never blocked on the provider response.【F:src/app/explorer/components/ExplorerQuickSearch.tsx†L80-L178】
2. **Parallel account hydration with single-state reuse.** `useExplorerData` issues account state, aggregated balances, and history requests concurrently, reuses the initial state snapshot for fallbacks, and maps history once both promises settle—eliminating the duplicate `getAccountState` call and the serial waterfall.【F:src/app/hooks/useExplorerData.ts†L66-L184】
3. **Shared token-metadata cache for balances.** `getAggregatedBalancesForOwner` now records tokens that still need metadata, reuses cached lookups across owner and storage balances, and batches remaining fetches through the global cache before finalizing totals.【F:src/lib/explorer/sdk-read-client.ts†L415-L568】
4. **History queries reuse the read client and cached metadata.** `getHistoryForAccount` relies on the shared reader, buffers operations while checking the cache, and enriches outstanding tokens with a single batched metadata request to avoid per-operation RPCs.【F:src/lib/explorer/sdk-read-client.ts†L582-L780】
5. **Lazy storage ACL loading.** Storage lookups respect an `enabled` flag, the `StorageList` notifies consumers when data is ready, and the account page enables the fetch only when the Storage tab is active—keeping the default view focused on the core account call.【F:src/components/storage-list.tsx†L48-L287】【F:src/app/explorer/account/[publicKey]/page.tsx†L188-L440】

## Perceived Loading Enhancements

- **Optimistic navigation with warm routes:** Quick search prefetches the chosen destination and refines the target asynchronously so the explorer transition starts within a single RTT.【F:src/app/explorer/components/ExplorerQuickSearch.tsx†L80-L178】
- **Stale-while-refresh account view:** The account page only falls back to the skeleton when no data is present, allowing existing content to remain visible while background refetches run.【F:src/app/explorer/account/[publicKey]/page.tsx†L188-L205】
- **On-demand storage metrics:** Storage counts update once the tab loads, showing a placeholder (`—`) until the deferred fetch completes to avoid competing with initial account hydration.【F:src/app/explorer/account/[publicKey]/page.tsx†L188-L440】

These changes shrink the address lookup critical path, reuse expensive metadata across the explorer, and keep UI sections responsive while slower data streams continue to populate.
