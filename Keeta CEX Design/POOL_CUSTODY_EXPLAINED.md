# Liquidity Pool Custody Flow - Comprehensive Explanation

**Created:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** Phases 1-2 Implemented ✅

This document answers all questions about how liquidity pool custody works with Keeta Network integration.

---

## 1. What Happens to User Balances?

### Current Implementation (Phases 1-2) ✅

When a user creates a liquidity pool:

**Step 1: Reserve Internal Balances**
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/pool_api.rs:202-213
if !state.ledger.reserve(user_id, &body.token_a, amount_a as f64) {
    return HttpResponse::BadRequest().json(json!({
        "error": "Insufficient balance for token A"
    }));
}
```

**Internal Ledger State:**
```
Before:
  demo-user:USDT  available: 1,000,000  total: 1,000,000

Reserve 100,000 USDT:
  demo-user:USDT  available: 900,000    total: 1,000,000  (reserved: 100,000)

Debit Total:
  demo-user:USDT  available: 900,000    total: 900,000    (moved to pool)
```

**Step 2: Credit LP Tokens**
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/pool_api.rs:295-296
state.ledger.credit(user_id, &pool.lp_token, pool.total_lp_supply as f64);
```

**Result:**
```
User balances AFTER pool creation:
  USDT: 900,000 (100,000 moved to pool)
  USDX: 900,000 (100,000 moved to pool)
  LP-USDT-USDX: 99,990 (new LP tokens received)
```

---

## 2. Where Are Funds Being Sent?

### Current Implementation ✅

**Keeta Storage Account Created:**
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/keeta.rs:56-88
pub async fn create_pool_storage_account(
    &self,
    pool_id: &str,
    token_a: &str,
    token_b: &str,
) -> Result<String, String> {
    // Creates: "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX"
    let storage_account = format!("keeta:storage:pool:{}:{}:{}", pool_id, token_a, token_b);
    
    // TODO: In production, this calls Keeta RPC:
    // - Generate storage account using Keeta SDK
    // - Set ACL permissions
    // - Submit to blockchain
    
    Ok(storage_account)
}
```

**Storage Account Characteristics:**
- **Address:** `keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX`
- **Type:** Generated storage account on Keeta Network
- **Owner:** Operator (pool manager)
- **Purpose:** Holds all pooled funds on-chain

**Fund Flow:**
```
User Wallet (S_user)
  ↓ (via SEND_ON_BEHALF permission)
Pool Storage Account (S_pool)
  ↓ (held in pool reserves)
Available for swaps and liquidity removal
```

## 3. How LPs Get Processed in the Backend

### Complete Processing Flow

#### Phase 1: Reserve & Validation
```rust
// Reserve user balances (prevents double-spend)
ledger.reserve(user_id, "USDT", 100000.0);  // Locks funds
ledger.reserve(user_id, "USDX", 100000.0);
```

#### Phase 2: Keeta Storage Account Setup
```rust
// Create storage account on Keeta blockchain
let storage_account = keeta_client.create_pool_storage_account(
    "USDT-USDX",
    "USDT",
    "USDX"
).await?;
// Returns: "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX"

// Setup ACL permissions
keeta_client.setup_pool_acl(
    &storage_account,
    "operator",
    vec!["USDT", "USDX"]  // Scoped to these tokens only
).await?;
```

#### Phase 3: Pool Creation & LP Calculation
```rust
// Calculate LP tokens using constant product formula
let liquidity = sqrt(amount_a * amount_b) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;
// For 100,000 × 100,000: sqrt(10,000,000,000) - 10 = 99,990

// Create pool in memory
pool_manager.create_pool(
    "USDT", "USDX",
    100000, 100000,
    30,  // 0.3% fee
    PoolType::ConstantProduct
)?;
```

#### Phase 4: Update Pool with On-Chain Address
```rust
// Link pool to Keeta storage account
pool_manager.update_storage_account(
    "USDT-USDX",
    "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX"
)?;
```

#### Phase 5: Settlement (TODO - Phase 3 of plan)
```rust
// TODO: Queue on-chain transfer
settlement_queue.enqueue_pool_deposit(PoolDeposit {
    user_id: "demo-user",
    pool_storage_account: "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX",
    token: "USDT",
    amount: 100000,
});

// This will:
// 1. Build Keeta transaction with SEND_ON_BEHALF
// 2. User signs transaction
// 3. Operator co-signs with delegation
// 4. Submit to Keeta network
// 5. Wait for consensus (400ms)
// 6. Confirm settlement
```

#### Phase 6: Ledger Finalization
```rust
// Debit user's total balance (funds now in pool)
ledger.debit_total(user_id, "USDT", 100000.0);
ledger.debit_total(user_id, "USDX", 100000.0);

// Credit LP tokens
ledger.credit(user_id, "LP-USDT-USDX", 99990.0);
```

**Result:**
```
Internal Ledger:
  demo-user:USDT → 900,000
  demo-user:USDX → 900,000
  demo-user:LP-USDT-USDX → 99,990 (new!)

Pool State:
  USDT-USDX:
    reserve_a: 100,000 USDT
    reserve_b: 100,000 USDX
    total_lp_supply: 99,990
    storage_account: keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX
```

## 4. Do Storage Accounts Have Rules?

### YES - ACL Permission Rules ✅

Storage accounts on Keeta have sophisticated Access Control Lists (ACL):

#### ACL Structure (from Keeta docs):
```javascript
// User Storage Account (S_user)
{
  "entity": "keeta:user:alice:storage",
  "acl_entries": [
    {
      "principal": "alice_public_key",
      "permissions": ["OWNER"],          // ✅ Full control
      "target": null                      // All tokens
    },
    {
      "principal": "operator_public_key",
      "permissions": ["SEND_ON_BEHALF"],  // ✅ Limited delegation
      "target": ["USDT", "USDX"]          // ✅ Scoped to specific tokens only
    }
  ],
  "default_permission": ["STORAGE_DEPOSIT"]  // Anyone can deposit
}
```

#### Pool Storage Account (S_pool):
```javascript
{
  "entity": "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX",
  "acl_entries": [
    {
      "principal": "operator_public_key",
      "permissions": ["OWNER"],           // ✅ Operator manages pool
      "target": null
    },
    {
      "principal": "*",                    // Any user
      "permissions": ["STORAGE_DEPOSIT"],  // Can deposit to pool
      "target": ["USDT", "USDX"]          // Only pool tokens
    }
  ],
  "token_permissions": [
    {
      "token": "USDT",
      "permission": "STORAGE_CAN_HOLD"     // ✅ Can hold USDT
    },
    {
      "token": "USDX",
      "permission": "STORAGE_CAN_HOLD"     // ✅ Can hold USDX
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Permission Hierarchy (from Keeta docs):

Permissions are read **most to least specific**:

1. **Exact match:** principal + entity + target
2. **General match:** principal + entity (no target)
3. **Default:** entity's default permission
4. **Empty:** No permission (denied)

**Example - Revoking Operator Permission:**
```javascript
// User can revoke operator's SEND_ON_BEHALF at any time:
user.updatePermissions(
  operator,
  [],  // Empty permissions = revoke
  "USDT",  // Specific target = most specific wins
  { account: storage_account }
);

// After revocation:
// - Operator can no longer send USDT from S_user
// - User still owns account (OWNER permission)
// - Other tokens still delegated
```

#### Rules Enforced by Keeta Network:

1. **Balance Requirements**
   - `SEND` operations check sender has sufficient balance
   - Validated at transaction validation time
   - Enforced by network consensus

2. **Permission Requirements**
   - `SEND_ON_BEHALF` required to send from another account
   - `STORAGE_DEPOSIT` required to deposit to storage account
   - `STORAGE_CAN_HOLD` required for storage account to hold token

3. **Ownership Rules**
   - Exactly ONE OWNER per storage account
   - OWNER can transfer ownership atomically
   - Cannot have zero or multiple owners

### Implementation Status:

✅ **Implemented:**
- Storage account creation (Phase 1)
- ACL setup method (Phase 1)
- ACL verification method (Phase 1)

⚠️ **TODO:**
- Actual Keeta RPC calls (currently placeholder)
- Production ACL configuration
- Permission verification before operations (Phase 6.1)

## 5. Guardrails to Keep User Funds Safe

### Security Mechanisms Implemented ✅

#### 5.1: Reserve/Debit Pattern (2-Phase Commit)
```rust
// Step 1: Reserve (lock funds, prevent double-spend)
if !ledger.reserve(user_id, token, amount) {
    return Error("Insufficient balance");
}

// Step 2: If settlement succeeds, debit
ledger.debit_total(user_id, token, amount);

// If settlement fails, rollback
ledger.release(user_id, token, amount);
```

**Prevents:**
- ❌ Double-spending
- ❌ Race conditions
- ❌ Partial transactions

#### 5.2: Rollback on Any Failure
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/pool_api.rs:223-231
Err(e) => {
    // Automatic rollback
    state.ledger.release(user_id, &body.token_a, amount_a as f64);
    state.ledger.release(user_id, &body.token_b, amount_b as f64);
    return HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json(json!({
        "error": format!("Failed: {}", e)
    }));
}
```

**Guarantees:**
- ✅ No funds lost if creation fails
- ✅ All-or-nothing semantics
- ✅ No partial pool states

#### 5.3: Minimum Liquidity Lock
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/pool.rs:102-111
const MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY: u64 = 10;

let liquidity = sqrt(amount_a * amount_b);
if liquidity <= MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY {
    return Err(PoolError::InsufficientLiquidity);
}

// Burn minimum liquidity (prevents inflation attacks)
Ok(liquidity - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY)
```

**Prevents:**
- ❌ Pool manipulation via inflation attacks
- ❌ Complete pool drainage
- ❌ Price manipulation

#### 5.4: Emergency Pause (Phase 6.2) ✅
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/pool.rs:128-143
pub fn pause_pool(&self, pool_id: &str) -> Result<(), PoolError> {
    let mut pool = self.pools.get_mut(pool_id)?;
    pool.paused = true;
    log::warn!("Pool {} has been PAUSED", pool_id);
    Ok(())
}

// All operations check pause status
if self.paused {
    return Err(PoolError::PoolPaused);
}
```

**Allows:**
- ✅ Immediate halt on suspicious activity
- ✅ Drift investigation
- ✅ Emergency response

#### 5.5: Scoped ACL Permissions
```rust
// File: keythings-dapp-engine/src/keeta.rs:98-117
pub async fn setup_pool_acl(
    &self,
    storage_account: &str,
    operator_key: &str,
    allowed_tokens: Vec<String>,  // ✅ Scoped to USDT and USDX only
) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Operator can only move pool tokens, nothing else
}
```

**Security Benefits:**
- ✅ Operator can't move unauthorized tokens
- ✅ Limited blast radius if operator key compromised
- ✅ User can revoke permissions at any time

### Guardrails NOT Yet Implemented ⚠️

#### TODO Phase 5: Reconciliation
```rust
// Verify on-chain balances match internal ledger
let on_chain_balance = keeta_client.verify_pool_reserves(storage_account, "USDT").await?;
let drift = on_chain_balance - internal_reserve;

if drift > threshold {
    pool_manager.pause_pool(pool_id)?;  // Auto-pause
    alert_operators(pool_id, drift);     // Notify
}
```

#### TODO Phase 6.1: Pre-Operation ACL Checks
```rust
// Before allowing deposit
let can_deposit = keeta_client.verify_acl(
    user_id,
    pool_storage_account,
    "STORAGE_DEPOSIT"
).await?;

if !can_deposit {
    return Error("Permission denied");
}
```

## 6. Keeta Network Interactions - Current vs. Planned

### What's Happening NOW (Demo Mode)

#### Current Pool Creation Flow:
```
User clicks "Create Pool"
  ↓
Frontend → Backend API (/pools/create)
  ↓
1. Reserve internal balances ✅
  ↓
2. Create storage account ✅ (deterministic string for demo)
  ↓
3. Setup ACL (logs only) ✅
  ↓
4. Create pool in memory ✅
  ↓
5. Update storage account ✅
  ↓
6. Debit internal ledger ✅
  ↓
7. Credit LP tokens ✅
  ↓
Return success to user
```

**Keeta Network Activity:** NONE (demo mode, no real blockchain transactions)

### What SHOULD Happen (Production Mode) - After Phase 3

#### Full On-Chain Flow:
```
User clicks "Create Pool"
  ↓
Frontend → Backend API (/pools/create)
  ↓
1. Reserve internal balances ✅
  ↓
2. Create storage account on Keeta blockchain:
   - Call Keeta SDK: generateIdentifier(STORAGE)
   - Sign block with operator key
   - Submit to Keeta network
   - Wait for vote staple (consensus)
   - 400ms settlement ✅
  ↓
3. Setup ACL permissions on-chain:
   - Build updatePermissions block
   - Set operator → SEND_ON_BEHALF (scoped to USDT, USDX)
   - Set default → STORAGE_DEPOSIT
   - Submit to Keeta
   - Wait for consensus (400ms)
  ↓
4. Create pool in memory ✅
  ↓
5. Queue settlement operations:
   - PoolDeposit: S_user → S_pool (USDT, 100000)
   - PoolDeposit: S_user → S_pool (USDX, 100000)
  ↓
6. Settlement worker executes:
   - Build SEND block signed by operator with SEND_ON_BEHALF
   - Submit to Keeta network
   - Representatives vote (consensus)
   - Block added to DAG
   - 400ms settlement ✅
  ↓
7. Settlement confirmed:
   - Debit internal ledger ✅
   - Credit LP tokens ✅
   - Mark settlement as complete
  ↓
8. Reconciliation (every 60s):
   - Query S_pool balances on-chain
   - Compare with internal reserves
   - If drift detected → pause pool
  ↓
Return success to user
```

**Keeta Network Activity:** Full on-chain custody with 400ms settlement

## 7. Are We Engineering This Correctly?

### Security Analysis

#### ✅ What's Correct (Phases 1-2):

**1. Non-Custodial Architecture**
- User maintains OWNER of their S_user account
- Operator only has SEND_ON_BEHALF (limited delegation)
- User can withdraw from S_user anytime
- **Keeta Alignment:** ✅ Matches Keeta's security model

**2. Scoped Permissions**
- Operator permissions scoped to specific tokens
- Can't move unauthorized assets
- Permission hierarchy allows revocation
- **Keeta Alignment:** ✅ Uses Keeta ACL properly

**3. Reserve/Debit Pattern**
- Atomic balance updates
- Rollback on failure
- No partial states
- **Keeta Alignment:** ✅ Follows best practices

**4. Minimum Liquidity Lock**
- Prevents inflation attacks
- Permanent lock (burned)
- Based on Uniswap V2 design
- **Keeta Alignment:** ✅ Standard AMM security

#### ⚠️ What's Missing (Phases 3-7):

**1. Actual On-Chain Settlement (Phase 3)**
```
Current:  Reserve → Debit → Done
Missing:  Reserve → Settlement → Confirm → Debit

Risk: Internal ledger can diverge from blockchain
Impact: HIGH - Funds not actually moved
Fix: Implement settlement queue integration
```

**2. Reconciliation (Phase 5)**
```
Current:  No drift detection
Missing:  Periodic on-chain balance verification

Risk: Silent divergence between internal and on-chain state
Impact: HIGH - Could allow theft or errors to go unnoticed
Fix: Implement reconciliation worker
```

**3. ACL Verification (Phase 6.1)**
```
Current:  Assumes all permissions granted
Missing:  Pre-operation permission checks

Risk: Could attempt unauthorized operations
Impact: MEDIUM - Keeta will reject, but wastes resources
Fix: Query ACL before operations
```

**4. Production Keeta Integration**
```
Current:  Placeholder RPC calls
Missing:  Real Keeta SDK integration

Risk: No actual blockchain custody
Impact: CRITICAL - Demo only, not production-ready
Fix: Replace placeholders with real Keeta SDK calls
```

### Keeta Network Validation

**What Keeta Will Check (when integrated):**

When we submit a `SEND` operation from S_user to S_pool:

1. **Balance Check:**
   ```
   Does S_user have enough USDT?
   Effect: balance[S_user][USDT] >= 100,000
   ```

2. **Permission Check:**
   ```
   Does operator have SEND_ON_BEHALF on S_user?
   Requirement: ACL[S_user][operator].permissions.includes("SEND_ON_BEHALF")
   ```

3. **Target Check:**
   ```
   Is SEND_ON_BEHALF scoped to USDT?
   Requirement: ACL[S_user][operator].target.includes("USDT") OR target == null
   ```

4. **Storage Check:**
   ```
   Can S_pool hold USDT?
   Requirement: ACL[S_pool][USDT].permissions.includes("STORAGE_CAN_HOLD")
   ```

5. **Consensus:**
   ```
   Do representatives agree this transaction is valid?
   Requirement: Quorum of votes (>50% voting weight)
   ```

**If any check fails:**
- ❌ Transaction rejected
- ❌ No state change
- ❌ Error returned to client
- ✅ Funds stay in original account

**Our implementation is correct** because:
- ✅ We create storage accounts with proper ACL
- ✅ We scope permissions to specific tokens
- ✅ We check balances before attempting operations
- ✅ We handle rollback on failures
- ✅ We follow Keeta's OWNER/SEND_ON_BEHALF model

**What we still need:**
- ⚠️ Replace placeholder RPC calls with real Keeta SDK
- ⚠️ Implement settlement queue for on-chain operations
- ⚠️ Add reconciliation to verify state
- ⚠️ Add pre-operation ACL checks

---

## Summary: Current Safety Status

### ✅ Strong Safeguards in Place:
1. Reserve/debit pattern (no double-spend)
2. Rollback on any failure (atomicity)
3. Minimum liquidity lock (anti-manipulation)
4. Emergency pause (incident response)
5. ACL permission structure (scoped delegation)

### ⚠️ Missing Safeguards (Phases 3-7):
1. On-chain settlement execution
2. Reconciliation worker
3. Pre-operation permission checks
4. Real Keeta SDK integration
5. Frontend settlement status

### 🎯 Overall Assessment:

**Architecture:** ✅ Excellent - Follows Keeta security model correctly  
**Implementation:** ⚠️ 40% Complete - Core structure solid, needs completion  
**Security:** ⚠️ Demo Only - Safe for testing, needs production hardening  
**Keeta Alignment:** ✅ Correct - Design matches Keeta's intended use

**Recommendation:** Complete Phases 3-7 before production deployment.

## What You Can Do Now (Demo Mode)

### ✅ Working:
- Create pools with any token pair
- Pools get Keeta storage account addresses
- User balances are debited correctly
- LP tokens are minted and credited
- Pools can be listed and queried
- Emergency pause available

### ⚠️ NOT Working (Yet):
- Actual on-chain transfers (funds stay in internal ledger)
- Settlement confirmation
- Reconciliation with blockchain
- Permission verification
- Add/remove liquidity settlement

### 🧪 Try This:
```bash
# Create a pool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/pools/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "token_a": "USDT",
    "token_b": "USDX",
    "initial_amount_a": "100000",
    "initial_amount_b": "100000",
    "fee_rate": 30
  }'

# Verify storage account
# Response will show: "storage_account": "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX"

# Check pools list
curl http://localhost:8080/api/pools/list
```
