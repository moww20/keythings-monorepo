# Wallet Connection Issue Fix

## Problem

After logging into the Keeta Wallet extension, the website still showed the "Connect Your Keeta Wallet" message instead of automatically connecting.

## Root Cause

The website was checking if the wallet was connected by calling `getAccounts()`, which returns an empty array if the website hasn't been granted permission yet. Even though the user logged into the wallet extension, the website needs **explicit permission** to connect.

The application was missing:
1. **Auto-reconnection logic** - If permission was previously granted, the wallet should automatically reconnect on page load
2. **Better wallet state detection** - The app needed to check multiple methods to determine if the wallet was previously connected

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Detection (`src/app/hooks/useWalletData.js`)

Added auto-reconnection logic that:
- Checks if the wallet was previously connected using `provider.isConnected()`
- Attempts to silently fetch accounts if permission was already granted
- Falls back gracefully if auto-connection fails

```javascript
// If no accounts, try checking if we should auto-connect
if (!accounts.length) {
  try {
    if (typeof provider.isConnected === 'function') {
      const wasConnected = await provider.isConnected();
      if (wasConnected) {
        console.log('Wallet was previously connected, attempting to reconnect...');
        accounts = (await provider.getAccounts()) ?? [];
      }
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.debug('Auto-connect check failed:', error);
  }
}
```

### 2. Created Auto-Connect Component (`src/app/components/WalletAutoConnect.js`)

New component that:
- Runs automatically on page load
- Checks if the wallet was previously connected
- Attempts to reconnect silently if permission was granted
- Only attempts once to avoid loops
- Logs helpful debug information

### 3. Integrated Auto-Connect (`src/app/components/AppProviders.js`)

Added the `WalletAutoConnect` component to the app providers so it runs on every page load.

## What You Need to Do

### First Time Connection

If this is your **first time** connecting the wallet to this website:

1. **Open your Keeta Wallet extension** and make sure you're logged in
2. **Refresh the website** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. You should see the "Connect Your Keeta Wallet" screen
4. **Click the "Connect Wallet" button**
5. The Keeta Wallet extension will show a popup asking for permission
6. **Approve the connection** in the extension popup
7. The website will now show your dashboard with your balance and tokens

### Subsequent Visits

After you've connected once:

1. **Open your Keeta Wallet extension** and unlock it (if locked)
2. **Refresh the website** or visit it
3. The website should **automatically connect** without needing to click "Connect Wallet"
4. If you see the dashboard, it worked! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still Showing "Connect Your Keeta Wallet"

**Solution 1: Clear Connection and Reconnect**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console
3. Look for messages like:
   - `"Wallet not previously connected, waiting for user action"` - This means you need to click "Connect Wallet"
   - `"Wallet was previously connected, reconnecting automatically..."` - This means auto-connect is working
4. Click "Connect Wallet" and approve the connection in the extension popup

**Solution 2: Check Wallet Extension**
1. Click the Keeta Wallet extension icon in Chrome
2. Make sure you're logged in (not showing a login screen)
3. Check if the wallet shows your account address
4. Try refreshing the website again

**Solution 3: Check Browser Console**
1. Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for any error messages related to:
   - `"Keeta wallet provider not found"` - Extension not installed or not working
   - `"Failed to fetch accounts"` - Extension not responding
   - `"User rejected the request"` - You declined the connection

### Problem: Wallet Shows as "Locked"

If you see the "Wallet Locked" screen:

1. Click the Keeta Wallet extension icon
2. Enter your password to unlock the wallet
3. Return to the website and click "Check Again"
4. The dashboard should now load with your balance

### Problem: Browser Console Errors

If you see errors in the console:

1. **`window.keeta is undefined`**
   - The Keeta Wallet extension is not installed or not enabled
   - Install the extension and refresh the page

2. **`getAccounts() failed`**
   - The wallet might be locked
   - Unlock the wallet extension and try again

3. **`Auto-connect attempt failed`**
   - This is normal if you haven't connected before
   - Click "Connect Wallet" to grant permission

## Technical Details

### How Auto-Connect Works

1. On page load, `WalletAutoConnect` component runs
2. It checks if `window.keeta` provider exists
3. It calls `provider.isConnected()` or checks `provider.isConnected` property
4. If the wallet was previously connected, it calls `connectWallet()`
5. The wallet automatically reconnects without user interaction
6. If permission wasn't granted before, it does nothing (user must click "Connect Wallet")

### Wallet State Flow

```
Page Load
    â†“
Check if provider exists (window.keeta)
    â†“
Check if previously connected (isConnected)
    â†“
    â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Auto-connect (getAccounts)
    â”‚         â†“
    â”‚         â”œâ”€ Success â†’ Show Dashboard

              â†“
         User clicks button
              â†“
         requestAccounts() 
              â†“
         Extension popup appears
              â†“
              â”œâ”€ User approves â†’ Connected â†’ Show Dashboard
              â””â”€ User rejects â†’ Show "Connect Wallet" button
```

## Support

If you're still having issues after trying these solutions:

**Summary**: The wallet should now automatically reconnect if you've previously granted permission. If this is your first time, click "Connect Wallet" and approve the connection in the extension popup.
