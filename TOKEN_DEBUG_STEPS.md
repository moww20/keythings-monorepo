# Token Loading Debug Steps

I've added extensive debug logging to the code. Here's how to diagnose the issue:

## Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. Open your website
2. Press **F12** to open DevTools
3. Click the **Console** tab
4. Refresh the page (F5)

## Step 2: Look for These Debug Messages

You should see logs like these in the console. **Copy ALL of them** and share with me:

### Wallet Connection Logs:
```
useWalletData: Token query state: {
  connected: true/false,
  isLocked: true/false,
  primaryAccount: "...",
  networkId: "...",
  isQueryEnabled: true/false
}
```

### Token Fetching Logs:
```
fetchTokenBalances: Fetching balances for account: ...
fetchTokenBalances: Raw balances from provider: [...]
fetchTokenBalances: Found X balance entries
```

### Individual Token Logs:
```
Checking balance for token: ... balance: ... hasBalance: ...
fetchTokenBalances: Non-zero balances: X
Processing token 1/X: { token: ..., balance: ..., hasMetadata: ... }
Processed token 1: { name: ..., ticker: ..., ... }
```

## Step 3: Check Wallet Provider

In the console, type these commands and share the results:

```javascript
// Check if provider exists
window.keeta

// Check if you can get accounts
await window.keeta.getAccounts()

// Check if you can get balances
await window.keeta.getAllBalances()

// Check base token
await window.keeta.getBaseToken()
```

## Common Issues to Check:

### Issue 1: Query Not Enabled
If you see:
```
isQueryEnabled: false
```

This means the token query isn't running. Check:
- `connected` should be `true`
- `isLocked` should be `false`
- `primaryAccount` should have an address

### Issue 2: getAllBalances() Returns Empty
If you see:
```
fetchTokenBalances: Raw balances from provider: []
```

This means the wallet provider is returning no balances. Possible reasons:
- The account truly has no tokens
- The wallet extension method `getAllBalances()` is not implemented correctly
- There's an error in the extension

### Issue 3: getAllBalances() Returns Undefined/Null
If you see:
```
fetchTokenBalances: balances is not an array: undefined
```

This means `getAllBalances()` is not returning the expected format.

### Issue 4: Balances Have Zero Amount
If you see:
```
Checking balance for token: xxx balance: 0 hasBalance: false
```

All your tokens have zero balance according to the extension.

## What to Share with Me:

1. **All console logs** starting from when you refresh the page
2. **Results from the wallet provider commands** (window.keeta.*)
3. **Screenshot** of your wallet extension showing the tokens

This will help me identify exactly where the issue is!
