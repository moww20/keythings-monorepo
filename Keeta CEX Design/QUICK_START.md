[INFO] keeta rpc url: https://rpc.testnet.keeta
[INFO] Backend starting on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

### Terminal 2: Frontend  
```bash
bun run dev -- -p 3000
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Ready on http://localhost:3000

## 🎯 Create Your First Pool

### Step 1: Open Frontend
```
http://localhost:3000/pools
```

### Step 2: Connect Wallet
```
1. Click "Connect Wallet" (if not connected)
2. Unlock your Keeta wallet extension
3. Your wallet address appears
```

### Step 3: Create Pool
```
1. Click "Create Pool" button
2. Select Pool Type: "Standard Pool"
3. Select Tokens: (from YOUR wallet)
   - Token A: USDT
   - Token B: USDX
4. Enter Amounts:
   - USDT Amount: 100  (any amount works now!)
   - USDX Amount: 100
5. Click "Next: Review"
6. Click "Create Pool"
```

### Step 4: Watch Settlement Status
```
Status 1: "Creating Pool..."

Status 3: "Pool Created Successfully!"
  → Your LP tokens have been credited
  
✅ Pool appears in list!
```

## ✅ What Works NOW

### With Your Real Wallet:

- ✅ Connect any Keeta wallet
- ✅ See your real tokens in dropdowns
- ✅ Create pools with ANY amounts (even 2 + 2!)
- ✅ Backend auto-credits balances on first use
- ✅ Your wallet address in backend logs
- ✅ Each user isolated
- ✅ Real storage account addresses
- ✅ Settlement queue active
- ✅ Reconciliation every 60s

### Backend Features:

- ✅ 8-step pool creation flow
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failures
- ✅ ACL permission structure
- ✅ Settlement queue (enqueues operations)
- ✅ Reconciliation worker (every 60s)
- ✅ Emergency pause capability
- ✅ Comprehensive logging

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Backend Not Running"

**Fix:**
```bash
cd keythings-dapp-engine
cargo run
```

**Verify:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok"}
```

### "Wallet not connected"

**Fix:**
1. Click "Connect Wallet" in frontend
2. Unlock Keeta wallet extension
3. Retry operation

### "Insufficient balance"

**Should NOT happen anymore!**
- Backend auto-credits 10M per token on first use
- If you still see this, restart backend

## 📊 Verify It's Working

### Check Backend Logs:

```
[INFO] Ledger initialized - balances from real Keeta wallets only
[INFO] create_pool wallet=kta:abc123... token_a=USDT amount_a=100
[WARN] New wallet detected, auto-crediting balances
[INFO] pool storage account created: keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX
[INFO] Wallet kta:abc123... credited with 99 LP tokens
[INFO] Starting periodic pool reconciliation
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ Your real wallet address (not "demo-user")
- ✅ Auto-credit warning (first time only)
- ✅ Storage account addresses
- ✅ LP token credits

### Check Frontend:

```
1. Pools page should load without errors
2. Your tokens show in dropdown (from wallet)
3. Create pool modal shows settlement status
4. Success message after creation
```
