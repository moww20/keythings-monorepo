# ✅ Keeta Testnet Integration - READY TO TEST

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ✅ **READY FOR TESTNET POOL CREATION**

---

## 🎉 **What Was Fixed**

### Issue: `userClient` Not Available
- **Problem:** `userClient` was being initialized asynchronously in `useEffect`, causing timing issues
- **Solution:** Changed to synchronous `useMemo` - creates client immediately when wallet unlocks

### Before (Async - Had Timing Issue):
```typescript
const [userClient, setUserClient] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  const init = async () => {
    const client = await provider.getUserClient(); // Async
    setUserClient(client); // State update delayed
  };
  init();
}, [connected, isLocked]);
```

### After (Sync - No Timing Issue):
```typescript
const userClient = useMemo(() => {
  if (!connected || isLocked) return null;
  const provider = window.keeta;
  // Use provider directly as userClient
  return provider as KeetaUserClient;
}, [connected, isLocked]);
```

## ✅ **Current Status**

### Backend ✅
- ✅ **Running on port 8080**
- ✅ **Pools API responding** (`/api/pools/list`)
- ✅ **Non-custodial architecture** (no operator key)
- ✅ **Query-only mode** (cannot move funds)

### Frontend ✅
- ✅ **Wallet connection** working
- ✅ **userClient initialization** fixed (synchronous)
- ✅ **CreatePoolModal** uses real Keeta SDK
- ✅ **Token balances** loading from wallet
- ✅ **No linting errors**

---

## 🚀 **How to Test Pool Creation**

### Step 1: Connect Wallet
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/pools`
2. Click "Connect Wallet" (if not already connected)
3. Approve in Keeta wallet extension
4. Verify wallet shows as connected in navbar

### Step 2: Create Pool
1. Click "Create Pool" button
2. **Step 1 - Select Pair:**
   - Choose Pool Type (Standard/Stable)
   - Select Token A from dropdown (e.g., KTA)
   - Select Token B from dropdown (e.g., BASE)
   - Select Fee Tier (0.3% recommended)
   - Click "Next: Add Liquidity"

3. **Step 2 - Add Liquidity:**
   - Enter amount for Token A (e.g., 10 KTA)
   - Enter amount for Token B (e.g., 100 BASE)
   - Review pool details (price, LP tokens)
   - Click "Review & Confirm"

4. **Step 3 - Confirm:**
   - Review pool summary
   - Click "Create Pool on Testnet"
   - **Console should show:**
     ```
     [CreatePool] Wallet status: { publicKey: "keeta_...", hasUserClient: true }
     [CreatePool] Starting pool creation on Keeta testnet
     [CreatePool] Builder initialized
     [CreatePool] Pool storage account generated
     ```

5. **Wallet Extension Should Prompt:**
   - "Sign transaction to create pool?"
   - Shows transaction details
   - User clicks "Approve"

6. **Keeta Settlement (400ms):**
   - Modal shows "Settling on Keeta Testnet"
   - Transaction hash displayed
   - Link to testnet explorer

7. **Success:**
   - Modal shows "Pool Created Successfully!"
   - Pool appears in pools list
   - LP tokens credited to wallet

## 🔍 **Console Logs to Expect**

### Successful Flow:
```
[WalletContext] ✅ User client ready (using provider directly)
[CreatePool] Wallet status: { publicKey: "keeta_...", hasUserClient: true, userClientType: "object" }
[CreatePool] Starting pool creation on Keeta testnet
[CreatePool] Token A: keeta_abc123 | Amount: 10
[CreatePool] Token B: keeta_def456 | Amount: 100
[CreatePool] Builder initialized
[CreatePool] Pool storage account generated: { publicKeyString: "keeta_pool_..." }
[CreatePool] Storage account permissions set
[CreatePool] Added send for token A
[CreatePool] Added send for token B
[CreatePool] Requesting user signature...
[CreatePool] Transaction published: { blocks: [...] }
[CreatePool] Waiting for Keeta settlement (400ms)...
[CreatePool] Notifying backend...
[CreatePool] Backend notified successfully
```

### If Wallet Not Connected:
```
[CreatePool] Wallet status: { publicKey: null, hasUserClient: false }
Error: Wallet not connected. Please connect your Keeta wallet first.
```

### If Wallet Locked:
```
[WalletContext] Provider does not have initBuilder/publishBuilder methods
[CreatePool] Wallet status: { publicKey: "keeta_...", hasUserClient: false }
Error: Keeta SDK not initialized. Please unlock your wallet and try again.
```

## 🔐 **Security Features Active**

### Non-Custodial Architecture:
- ✅ **User signs ALL transactions** via wallet extension
- ✅ **User is OWNER** of pool storage account
- ✅ **Backend has NO operator key** (cannot move funds)
- ✅ **Backend tracks state only** (UI display)
- ✅ **All transactions on-chain** (Keeta testnet explorer)

### Transaction Details Visible:
- Pool storage account address
- Token transfer amounts
- Transaction hash
- Explorer link for verification

---

## 📊 **What Happens On-Chain**

When you create a pool, the following happens on Keeta testnet:

1. **Storage Account Created:**
   - New account address generated
   - User set as OWNER
   - Permissions: `STORAGE_DEPOSIT`, `STORAGE_CAN_HOLD`

2. **Tokens Transferred:**
   - `amountA` of `tokenA` sent to pool storage
   - `amountB` of `tokenB` sent to pool storage
   - User's wallet debited
   - Pool storage account credited

3. **LP Tokens Minted:**
   - Calculated as `sqrt(amountA * amountB) - 1`
   - Tracked by backend
   - User maintains ownership

4. **All Visible on Explorer:**
   - Transaction hash: `https://testnet.keeta.network/tx/{hash}`
   - Storage account: `https://testnet.keeta.network/account/{address}`
   - Token transfers visible

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

### To Test:
1. **Refresh your browser** at `http://localhost:3000/pools`
2. **Connect your Keeta wallet** (if not connected)
3. **Ensure wallet is unlocked** (check extension)
4. **Click "Create Pool"**
5. **Follow the 3-step wizard**
6. **Approve in wallet** when prompted
7. **Verify on testnet explorer**

### Expected Result:
- ✅ Transaction signed in wallet
- ✅ Pool created on Keeta testnet
- ✅ Pool appears in UI
- ✅ Transaction visible on explorer
- ✅ Your wallet debited
- ✅ LP tokens credited (tracked)

---

## 🐛 **If Issues Occur**

### "Keeta SDK not initialized":
1. Check console for `[WalletContext] ✅ User client ready`
2. Ensure wallet is unlocked (not just connected)
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting wallet
4. Refresh page

### "Failed to generate pool storage account":
1. Check wallet extension is latest version
2. Verify provider has `initBuilder` method
3. Check console for SDK errors

### "Transaction failed":
1. Verify you have enough testnet tokens
2. Check transaction in Keeta explorer
3. Ensure amounts meet minimum liquidity (sqrt(a*b) > 1)
