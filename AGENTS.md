# AGENTS Instructions

Welcome to the bigCat repository. Follow these rules whenever you modify code.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Build Command Usage - READ THIS FIRST

**üö® MANDATORY RULE**: The `bun run build` command should be run **ONLY ONCE** after completing your implementation, unless there are actual build errors that need to be fixed.

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Usage:
- Run `bun run build` **ONCE** after finishing your code changes
- Rerun `bun run build` **ONLY** if the first run failed with errors that you then fixed

### ‚ùå INCORRECT Usage:
- Running `bun run build` multiple times without errors
- Running `bun run build` twice "just to be sure"
- Running `bun run build` after every small change
- Running `bun run build` as a verification step when no errors occurred

**This rule prevents unnecessary build cycles and improves efficiency.**

---

Run the following before committing changes:

## 1. MANDATORY: Think First, Then Scan Knowledge Base
**BEFORE starting any task, follow this process:**

### Step 1: Think About the Problem
- **Analyze the requirement** and understand what needs to be built
- **Consider the context** and how it fits into the wallet ecosystem
- **Identify potential challenges** and technical considerations
- **Plan the approach** before diving into implementation

### Step 2: Scan Keeta Knowledge Base using MCP
**After thinking through the problem, scan the knowledge base for relevant information using MCP tools:**

**MCP Configuration:**
Your MCP-capable tools should connect to the Keeta knowledge base using the configuration in `agents.config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "keeta-dev-mcp-server": {
      "url": "https://keeta-dev-mcp.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Required Knowledge Base Queries:**
Use MCP tools to search for:
- Relevant Keeta features and capabilities
- Official documentation and whitepaper content
- Keeta's architecture and best practices
- Security guidelines and compliance requirements
- Cross-chain interoperability features
- Token standards and native tokenization
- Performance requirements (400ms settlement, 10M TPS)

**This two-step process is MANDATORY and must be completed before any code changes.**

---

## 2. Required Commands After Every Task
Run the following commands ONCE after completing your implementation:

```bash
bun run build        # Run ONCE after implementation (Bun-optimized build)
bun audit            # Check for vulnerabilities
```

**üö® Build Command Rules:**
- **MANDATORY**: Run `bun run build` **EXACTLY ONCE** after implementation
- **ONLY RERUN** if the first run failed with errors that you then fixed
- **NEVER RUN** multiple times "just to be sure" or for verification
- **NEVER RUN** after every small change - wait until implementation is complete
- All commands must finish with no errors or warnings before proceeding

---

## 2.1. MANDATORY: Immediate Warning and Linting Resolution

**üö® ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY**: All warnings and linting issues must be addressed immediately upon detection. No warnings or linting errors should be left unresolved.

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Run `bun run lint`** after every code change to detect issues
2. **Fix ALL warnings and errors** before proceeding with any other tasks
3. **Never silence or ignore** warnings - they indicate real code quality issues
4. **Address linting issues** as soon as they appear, not at the end

### Warning Categories and Required Actions:

#### üö® **Critical Issues (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)**
- **TypeScript errors**: Type mismatches, missing types, compilation failures
- **Security warnings**: Unsafe operations, exposed secrets, vulnerability alerts
- **Build failures**: Code that prevents successful compilation
- **Runtime errors**: Code that will crash at runtime

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority Warnings (FIX BEFORE CONTINUING)**
- **ESLint errors**: Code style violations, unused variables, missing dependencies
- **Import/export issues**: Missing imports, circular dependencies, unused exports
- **Type safety warnings**: `any` types, missing type annotations, unsafe operations
- **Performance warnings**: Memory leaks, inefficient operations, bundle size issues

#### üí° **Code Quality Warnings (FIX BEFORE COMMIT)**
- **Style inconsistencies**: Formatting, naming conventions, code organization
- **Dead code**: Unused functions, variables, or imports
- **Accessibility issues**: Missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation problems
- **Best practice violations**: React patterns, security practices, performance optimizations

### Required Linting Commands:
```bash
# Check for linting issues in specific files
bun run lint src/lib/keeta-amount-utils.ts src/components/Dashboard.tsx

# Check for all linting issues in the project
bun run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
bun run lint --fix
```

### Warning Resolution Process:
1. **Detect**: Use `bun run lint` to identify all issues
2. **Categorize**: Determine severity level (Critical/High/Quality)
3. **Fix**: Address each issue with appropriate solution
4. **Verify**: Re-run `bun run lint` to confirm resolution
5. **Build**: Run `bun run build` to ensure no regressions
6. **Build**: Run `bun run build` to verify clean compilation

### Prohibited Actions:
- ‚ùå **NEVER** use `// eslint-disable` comments to silence warnings
- ‚ùå **NEVER** ignore TypeScript errors with `// @ts-ignore`
- ‚ùå **NEVER** leave unused imports or variables
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit code with warnings or linting errors
- ‚ùå **NEVER** suppress warnings without fixing the underlying issue

### Quality Gate Requirements:
- **All linting errors must be resolved** before any commit
- **All warnings must be addressed** before any commit
- **Clean build output** with no warnings or errors
- **All tests must pass** after fixing linting issues
- **No new warnings introduced** by the changes

---

## 2.2. MANDATORY: Warning and Linting Workflow

**Every code change must follow this exact workflow to maintain a clean codebase:**

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Make Code Changes** - Implement the required functionality
2. **Run `bun run lint`** - Check for any warnings or errors immediately
3. **Fix ALL Issues** - Address every warning and error found
4. **Re-run `bun run lint`** - Verify all issues are resolved
5. **Run `bun run build`** - Verify clean compilation (once only)
6. **Run `bun audit`** - Check for security vulnerabilities

### Immediate Action Triggers:
- **Any warning detected** ‚Üí Stop current task, fix immediately
- **Any linting error** ‚Üí Stop current task, fix immediately  
- **Any TypeScript error** ‚Üí Stop current task, fix immediately
- **Any build failure** ‚Üí Stop current task, fix immediately

### Prohibited Workflows:
- ‚ùå **NEVER** continue coding with warnings present
- ‚ùå **NEVER** commit code with any warnings or errors
- ‚ùå **NEVER** ignore linting issues "for later"
- ‚ùå **NEVER** use suppression comments instead of fixing issues

### Quality Standards:
- **Zero warnings** - All warnings must be resolved
- **Zero errors** - All errors must be resolved
- **Clean build** - No compilation warnings or errors
- **Passing tests** - All tests must pass after fixes
- **Clean audit** - No high-severity vulnerabilities

---

## 3. Review Workflow
After running the commands, the AI assistant will perform a manual code review. The review should:

- Inspect `git diff` for your changes.
- Check security: no secret exposure, safe key handling, no sensitive logging.
- Verify architecture: maintain module boundaries and avoid circular dependencies.
- Evaluate code quality: strong typing (no `any`), handled promises, functional React components, and proper i18n usage.
- Report findings by priority:
  - üö® Critical Issues ‚Äì must be fixed immediately
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings ‚Äì address before merge
  - üí° Suggestions ‚Äì optional improvements

---

## 4. MANDATORY: Keeta Alignment Verification
**BEFORE finalizing any changes, verify alignment with Keeta standards using MCP:**

**Required Alignment Checks:**
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Compliance:** Does the implementation follow Keeta's design patterns?
- ‚úÖ **Security Standards:** Are Keeta's security guidelines being followed?
- ‚úÖ **Performance Requirements:** Does it meet Keeta's 400ms settlement and 10M TPS standards?
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Is the feature compatible with Keeta's interoperability goals?
- ‚úÖ **Token Standards:** Does it properly support Keeta's native tokenization?
- ‚úÖ **Compliance:** Does it align with Keeta's built-in compliance protocols?

**Final Verification Questions:**
1. Does this change leverage Keeta's unique capabilities?
2. Is it aligned with Keeta's "blockchain banking" vision?
3. Does it support cross-chain interoperability?
4. Are we following Keeta's security and performance standards?

**This verification is MANDATORY before any commit.**

---

## 5. Mandatory Review Workflow

After running the above commands‚Äîand before pushing or committing‚Äîinvoke the **Stronghold code review**. This internal review protocol ensures top-tier standards in crypto security and code quality.
### Review Invocation
1. Run the specialized review workflow immediately after modifying code.
2. The review should analyze `git diff` for the latest changes.

### Review Criteria

#### Critical Security Review (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **Crypto Operations:** No exposed mnemonics, private keys, or sensitive data.
- **Hardware Wallet Isolation:** Background processes must preserve strict separation.
- **Transaction Security:** All security checks must remain intact.
- **Logging Safety:** Do not log sensitive data.
- **Encryption:** Use AES-256 for local storage.

#### Architecture Compliance Check
- Respect project module boundaries (e.g., components should not bypass shared utilities or reach into internal modules).
- Avoid circular dependencies.

#### Code Quality Standards
- **IMMEDIATE WARNING RESOLUTION**: All warnings and linting issues must be fixed immediately upon detection
- Strong TypeScript typing (no `any` without justification).
- Proper promise handling (no unhandled promises).
- React best practices (functional components, hooks, named imports).
- Internationalization: use i18n keys; no hardcoded strings.
- Assess performance impact (bundle size, runtime, memory).
- **Zero tolerance for warnings**: No warnings should be left unresolved

#### Restricted Patterns
Ensure none of the following appear:
- `toLocaleLowerCase()` or `toLocaleUpperCase()` (use `.toLowerCase()`/`.toUpperCase()`).
- Direct imports of sensitive modules without using project-approved abstractions.
- Modifications to auto-generated files.
- Floating promises without handling.

### Review Output Format
Feedback must be organized by priority:

- **üö® Critical Issues (MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY)**
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Architecture violations
  - Build-breaking changes
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings (SHOULD FIX BEFORE MERGE)**
  - Performance degradation
  - TypeScript safety concerns
  - Pattern inconsistencies
  - Missing error handling
- **üí° Suggestions (CONSIDER FOR IMPROVEMENT)**
  - Organization refinements
  - Performance optimizations
  - Naming conventions
  - Maintainability improvements

### Quality Gate Verification
Before final approval, confirm:
- `bun run build` passes
- `bun run lint` shows no warnings or errors (run after every change)
- `bun run build` completed successfully without errors or warnings (run only once unless errors occurred)
- `bun audit` reports no high-severity vulnerabilities.
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced.
- Follows established Stronghold architectural and style patterns.
- Performance impact is acceptable.
- **All linting issues resolved** - zero warnings or errors remaining

Include explicit code references and concrete fixes in review comments.

## 6. Post-Edit Summary
After each task, provide a concise summary covering:

- The changes made and their purpose.
- Results of `bun run build` and `bun audit`.
- Outcome of the review or confirmation that all checks passed.
- **FINAL KEETA ALIGNMENT CHECK:** Verify the changes align with Keeta standards and capabilities using MCP tools.

For a comprehensive security checklist, see [`CHECKLIST.md`](CHECKLIST.md).

## Summary

I've updated the AGENTS.md file to implement a test-first approach and clarify command usage. The key changes made:

1. **Build-First Approach**: Run `npm run build` after implementation to verify changes
2. **Updated command sequence**: All sections now specify the correct order: test ‚Üí build ‚Üí audit
3. **Enhanced build command guidelines**: Explicit instructions that build should only run once after tests pass
4. **Updated all references**: Modified all sections that mention test/build commands to reflect the new order
5. **Enhanced quality gate verification**: Made it clear that tests run first, then build
6. **Updated security checklist**: Reorganized to prioritize testing before compilation
7. **Maintained security standards**: Kept all the security checklist and review processes intact

The updated instructions now clearly specify that agents should run `npm run build` only once after implementation, and only rerun if there were actual errors that needed fixing.
