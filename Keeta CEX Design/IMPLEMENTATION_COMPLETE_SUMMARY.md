## 🧪 Test It

```bash
# Start backend
cd keythings-dapp-engine && cargo run

# Create pool
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/pools/create \
  -d '{"token_a":"USDT","token_b":"USDX","initial_amount_a":"100000","initial_amount_b":"100000"}'

# Response:
{
  "pool_id": "USDT-USDX",
  "storage_account": "keeta:storage:pool:USDT-USDX:USDT:USDX",  # ✅ Keeta address
  "lp_token": "LP-USDT-USDX",
  "lp_tokens_minted": "99990"
}
```
